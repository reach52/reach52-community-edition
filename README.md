## Features
* mWallets
* Generic Payment gateway
* Supplier Onboarding
* Discounts/Points logics

## Installation/Deployment
This is an API open source project built in Node.js and hence this project needs to be deployed on to a server.

There are many ways of hosting the API but for the sake of simplicity, lets take the case of hosting this in AWS from where your endpoints are to be exposed. To do this, please follow the steps mentioned [here](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-serverless-web-app-lambda-apigateway-s3-dynamodb-cognito/module-4/).

***Once the hosting is done, you can test the end-points using any REST client like Postman***

## Tests
Stpes on how to run the tests will be added once the tests are ready in the repo.

## How to use?
Steps will be added here
