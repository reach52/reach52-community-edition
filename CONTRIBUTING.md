***Code of Conduct***
This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the reach52 Community edition's Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to lakshmi@reach52.com.

Note: Please don't file an issue to ask a question. You'll get faster results by using the resources below.

What should I know before I get started?
reach52 Community edition is a HealthCare e-commerce based open source project. 
Also, because reach52 Community edition is so extensible, it's possible that a feature you've become accustomed to in reach52 Community edition or an issue you're encountering isn't coming from a bundled package at all, but rather a community package you've installed. Each community package has its own repository too.

Reporting Bugs
This section guides you through submitting a bug report for reach52 Community edition. 
Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports üîé.

***Before creating bug reports***, please check this list (Link TBD) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include an appropriate title, steps to reproduce, and a screenshot. and as many more details as possible.

Note: If you find a Closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

Before Submitting A Bug Report
Check the FAQs on the forum for a list of common questions and problems.
Determine which repository the problem should be reported in.
Perform a cursory search to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

***How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?***
Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. After you've determined which repository your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in the template.

***Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:***

Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started reach52 Community edition, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal, or how you started the app otherwise. When listing steps, don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut, and if so which one?
Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use Markdown code blocks.
Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
Include screenshots and animated GIFs which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. If you use the keyboard while following the steps, record the GIF with the Keybinding Resolver shown. You can use this tool to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and this tool or this tool on Linux.
If you're reporting that reach52 Community edition crashed, include a crash report with a stack trace from the operating system. On macOS, the crash report will be available in Console.app under "Diagnostic and usage information" > "User diagnostic reports". Include the crash report in the issue in a code block, a file attachment, or put it in a gist and provide link to that gist.
If the problem is related to performance or memory, include a CPU profile capture with your report.
If Chrome's developer tools pane is shown without you triggering it, that normally means that you have a syntax error in one of your themes or in your styles.less. Try running in Safe Mode and using a different theme or comment out the contents of your styles.less to see if that fixes the problem.
If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.
Provide more context by answering these questions:

Can you reproduce the problem in safe mode?
Did the problem start happening recently (e.g. after updating to a new version of reach52 Community edition) or was this always a problem?
If the problem started happening recently, can you reproduce the problem in an older version of reach52 Community edition? What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen? 
Can you reliably reproduce the issue? If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
If the problem is related to working with files (e.g. opening and editing files), does the problem happen for all files and projects or only some? Does the problem happen only when working with local or remote files (e.g. on network drives), with files of a specific type (e.g. only JavaScript or Python files), with large files or files with very long lines, or with files in a specific encoding? Is there anything else special about the files you are using?
Include details about your configuration and environment:

What's the name and version of the OS you're using?
Which packages do you have installed? You can get that list by running apm list --installed.
Are you using local configuration files config.cson, keymap.cson, snippets.cson, styles.less and init.coffee to customize reach52 Community edition? If so, provide the contents of those files, preferably in a code block or with a link to a gist.
Are you using reach52 Community edition with multiple monitors? If so, can you reproduce the problem when you use a single monitor?
Which keyboard layout are you using? Are you using a US layout or some other layout?
Suggesting Enhancements

clear = (count=1) -> instead of clear = (count = 1) ->
Use spaces around operators
count + 1 instead of count+1
Use spaces after commas (unless separated by newlines)
Use parentheses if it improves code clarity.
Prefer alphabetic keywords to symbolic keywords:
a is b instead of a == b
Avoid spaces inside the curly-braces of hash literals:
{a: 1, b: 2} instead of { a: 1, b: 2 }
Include a single line of whitespace between methods.
Capitalize initialisms and acronyms in names, except for the first word, which should be lower-case:
getURI instead of getUri
uriToOpen instead of URIToOpen
Use slice() to copy an array
Add an explicit return when your function ends with a for/while loop and you don't want it to return a collected array.
Use this instead of a standalone @
return this instead of return @

Specs Styleguide
Include thoughtfully-worded, well-structured Jasmine specs in the ./spec folder.
Treat describe as a noun or situation.

Issue and Pull Request Labels
This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests.

GitHub search makes it easy to use labels for finding groups of issues or pull requests you're interested in. 

The labels are loosely grouped by their purpose, but it's not required that every issue has a label from every group or that an issue can't have more than one label from the same group.
